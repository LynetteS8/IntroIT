<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>Lynette Stott
(registerd at Uni as Lynette Kemp for now)
S3728067@student.rmit.edu.au

S3728067

I grew up on a remote farm on the West coast of SA, on the edge of the nullabor, my family had lived in the area for many generations, as a teenager I moved to Port Augusta.

After school I initially moved to Adelaide to attend Uni but dropped out to return home, I did some Tafe courses and completed a Certificate 2 in business administration

2 years after high school I was approved for a UK working Visa and spent 2 years based out of London, I travelled throughout Europe, Mexico, Syria, Jordan and Egypt, this was 2001-2003, so before Syria was destroyed.

Returning home I went on complete a Certificate 4 in Accounting. Whilst working as a paraplanner I undertook study to gain a Diploma in Financial Planning. I returned to Uni to do a Bachelor of Accounting, attending some classes at UniSA Whyalla campus. Due to personal reasons and the Whyalla campus no longer doing accounting I took some time off from Uni and returned last year via Open Universities.

When I needed a break from financial planning I set up and operated my own retail business for 5 years, during 2 of those years I had a second shop 75 km away. Due to the local economy and my divorce I closed the store down and having since being working in an administration position, this position offers me flexibility which I need with 2 children but is not something I would want to be doing long term. </p>


<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>  My parents were into gaming so I grew up with an Atari system and remember the excitement of the new commodore 64. At my small primary school I got to set up the new apple computers as I finished my work early.  I found most of the computing classes at school easy and ended up helping others often.

When I attended Uni originally out of high school I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science with the plan to major in math, my first 4 subjects were math, C+, communications & Visual Basics, I soon found that having previously done math 2 by correspondence that listening to a lecture sounded like I was listening to a different language so dropped out and found myself enjoying the programming courses but ended up returning home before the 1st semester was over for personal reasons.

When I returned to do an accounting course I did look at other options but was convinced I should stick to accounting as there would be more career opportunities locally, it took me 3 years after my divorce to sit down and really think what I wanted for my future and decide on a new direction, which is how I ended up enrolling in this course.  I always end up being the person that helps with IT at each place I work and I want to be able to do more than my current skillset allows.  </p>
